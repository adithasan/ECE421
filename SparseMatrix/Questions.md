Questions
=========
1. What is a sparse matrix and what features should it possess?

   A sparse matrix is a matrix where most of the cells have the value 0. It
   should support input and output.

2. What sources of information should you consult to derive features? Do
   analogies exist? If so with what?
   
   We should consult Wikipedia and mathematicians on features that would be
   useful to implement. We can also consult other implementations for useful
   features to implement.
